TODO list for OpenGL engine on Mac OS X
---------------------------------------

- LEARN Read OpenGLProg_MacOSX.pdf to understand OSX windows
- NEW Setup an AGL context/window in Mac OS X and have the GL Triangle demo working
- NEW Try a few OpenGL examples. Try to determine if shaders will work with this config
- NEW Implement basic camera object: fixed view angle, depth of field, etc... and get the GLTriangle demo up and running again with the static camera
- NEW Attach camera to OSX keys/mouse to move camera around

-- DEMO -- Application with triangle and camera navigation around triangle

- NEW Implement basic mesh loader (ASC/OBJ/3DS) without textures
- NEW Implement mesh renderer without textures
- NEW Add lights in case mesh is not shown properly

-- DEMO -- Application with demo meshes and camera navigation around it

- NEW Add texture support to meshes

-- DEMO -- Application with textured demo meshes and camera navigation around it

- LEARN Camera properties DOF, view angle, etc... to implement improved camera with Ortho and improved perspective support
- EXTEND Camera object to support Perspective and Ortho, and configurable DOF/Angle etc...

-- DEMO -- Texture mesh demo with adjustable 3D camera and switch to 2D camera

- LEARN Read about vertex shaders
- NEW Implement basic vertex shader loader. It an be attached to meshes and used in the render process.

-- DEMO -- Textured mesh with shaders

- LEARN Vertex buffers
- NEW Implement meshes with vertex buffers

-- DEMO -- ??

- LEARN Stripping meshes to generate strip triangles
- NEW Implement mesh stripper. Integrate with vertex buffers?

-- DEMO -- ??
